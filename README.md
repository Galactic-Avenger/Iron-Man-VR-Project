# Iron Man AR/VR Combat Simulation with AI Assistance

This is a Virtual Reality five scenes game that lets you use Iron Man abilities. You can shoot repulsor beams, fly around, and fight bad guys like Thanos. We built this because we're  Marvel fans and wanted to experience being Iron Man in VR!

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview

This project recreates the experience of being inside an Iron Man suit through Virtual Reality, allowing users to engage in combat scenarios and interact with an AI assistant (J.A.R.V.I.S.). Built as a team project for a VR/AR/MR college course, the simulation features multiple training scenes and a final boss battle against Thanos.

## âœ¨ Features
